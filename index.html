        Karachi (/kəˈrɑːtʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəˈraːtʃi] (listen)) is the most populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous city in the world, with a population of over 20 million.[17][18][19] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast. It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh. Ranked as a beta-global city,[20][21] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[22] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[15][16] Karachi paid $9 billion (25% of whole country) as tax during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[23] as well as one of Pakistan's most socially liberal cities.[24][25][26] Karachi serves as a transport hub, and contains Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[27] Karachi is also a media center, home to news channels, film and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational companies and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, historic buildings and shopping malls.

        The region has been inhabited for millennia,[28] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[29][30] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[30] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[23] Following the independence of Pakistan, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from India,[31] coupled with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents, whose numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[32][33] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[34] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[35] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[36][37][38]
        
        Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[39][40] Karachi collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[41] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[42][43] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[44] while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[45] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[45] Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,[46][47] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[48][49]
        
        Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[50] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[51] The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.[52] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's 6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 128th by 2022.[53]

        Etymology
        Before independence, the city was widely known as Karanchi in Urdu, though the English spelling Karachi became more popular over time.[54]
        
        Modern Karachi was reputedly founded in 1729 as the settlement of Kolachi-jo-Goth during the rule of Kalhora dynasty.[29] The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi, whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile in the village after his elder brothers had already been killed by it.[29] The name Karachee, a shortened and corrupted version of the original name Kolachi-jo-Goth, was used for the first time in a Dutch report from 1742 about a shipwreck near the settlement.[55][56]

       <br> Early history
        <br>
        The 15th–18th century Chaukhandi tombs are a Tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.
        
        The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the ancient Greeks, and may have been the site of Barbarikon, an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the Indus River.[57][58][59][60] Karachi may also have been referred to as Ramya in ancient Greek texts.[61]
        
        The ancient site of Krokola, a natural harbor west of the Indus where Alexander the Great sailed his fleet for Achaemenid Assyria, may have been located near the mouth of Karachi's Malir River,[62][63][64] though some believe it was located near Gizri.[65][66] No other natural harbor exists near the mouth of the Indus that could accommodate a large fleet.[67] Nearchus, who commanded Alexander's naval fleet, also mentioned a hilly island by the name of Morontobara and an adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions.[68][69][70] Both areas were island until well into the colonial era, when silting in led to them being connected to the mainland.[71]
        
        In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from where he launched his forces further into the Indus Valley in 712.[72] Some have identified the port with Karachi, though some argue the location was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta.[73][74]
        
        Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus River Delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese incursions into Sindh. In 1553–54, Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis, mentioned a small port along the Sindh coast by the name of Kaurashi which may have been Karachi.[75][76][77] The Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi's modern suburbs were built around this time between the 15th and 18th centuries.
